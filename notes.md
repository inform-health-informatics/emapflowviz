started with an empty directory
followed notes from https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/#working-with-multiple-environments
set-up an isolated pyenv    

```bash
# I chose 3.7.4 because it was the most up-to-date non-dev version
pyenv install -v 3.7.4 # if not already installed
pyenv virtualenv 3.7.4 emapfloviz
```
